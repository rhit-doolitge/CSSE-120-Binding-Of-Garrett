3. Explain briefly what your project does and how it works.

     [PUT YOUR ANSWER HERE, using as many lines as you need.]
     Our project is a dungeon crawler game that works by entering new rooms through doors. Each room you enter has a
     random amount of enemies rocks and a chance to spawn an item. These items can boost your stats but some also reduce
     other stats as a sort of trade off. Watch out because some doors are secret one way tunnels that you can't
     go back through the other way. After twenty rooms you have the option to fight a boss by going through the distinct
     boss door. After entering the boss room there is no option to leave the boss door, and you are done with that floor
     If you beat the boss you go to the next floor and each time you beat the boss he gets harder. After 3
     floors you beat the game but have the option to continue playing more floors for fun. There are multiple characters
     you can start as with the main character being garrett and others being group members and other friends. There is
     also the option to resize the screen to windowed fullscreen which works well if you have a 16:10 display otherwise
     the bottom of the game goes behind the taskbar, and you have to play in the windowed version of the game.
